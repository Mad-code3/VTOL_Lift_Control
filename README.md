# VTOL_Lift_Control
The Simulink simulation shows a VTOL’s altitude response using PID control. The system lifts off quickly, peaks at around 18 m, and then gradually stabilizes with mild oscillations. It reflects an underdamped but stable system, effectively managing lift and gravity for controlled vertical motion.
